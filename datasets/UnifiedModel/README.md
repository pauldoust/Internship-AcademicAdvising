This folder contains:
	1) semesters.txt: text file represinting stero-typical semster found using pattern mining (please check dataset/lcm and software/lcm). Each line in this file is parsed and a module is build using script (software/main_script), here we have two lines, hence we have two folders (experiment1, experiment2)
	2) experiment1: a unified model corresponding to a stereo-typical semester specified in semesters.txt
	3) experiment2: a unified model corresponding to a stereo-typical semester specified in semesters.txt
