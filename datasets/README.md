	1) Main_Dataset: The primary dataset annonymized by Luis
	2) Experiment_Algorithms: case study for preicting algorithm in iterms of other courses ad predictors
	3) Experiment_StatisticPath: case study for predicting Statistics (small size because of the indicators)
	4) Experiment_StatisticsUnifiedRepeatersNonRepeaters: case study for predicting statistics with different predictors (large), splitted into two datasets for repeaters and non-repeaters.
	5) Experiment_StatisticsRepeatersNonRepeaters: case study similar to the previous one but by unifying the datasets of repeaters and non-repeaters
	6) LCM: the files related to apply LCM closed-pattern mining algorithm to extract stereo-typical semesters
